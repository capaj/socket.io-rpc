## ChangeLog
### 0.8.8 -> 0.8.9
Client now separated in another npm package. use npm install socket.io-rpc-client to get it.
### 0.6.9 -> 0.7.0
Now only usable with commonJS compatible module loader. I strongly advise to use systemJS module loader in the browser.
### 0.5.4 -> 0.6.0
More reasonable public API refactor, which now requires you to connect before you can load channels
### 0.3.18 -> 0.3.19
Finally a proper version of socket.io, so I removed temporary hacks from client channels instantiation, updated express.js peerDependency to ~4
### 0.3.12 -> 0.3.13
channel is now injected into the controller, not put on scope as a property as before, be aware when updating
### 0.3.9 -> 0.3.10
Switched once again promise library, now to Bluebird for even better performance, I doubt that any faster promise implementation will replace it any time in next year, so bluebird will last longer than the last two
### 0.2.5 -> 0.3.0
Synchronous resolution of a call can be now also rejected without need to create and reject a promise by simply returning an instance of Error
### 0.1.3 -> 0.1.4
Added a directive to angularJS client to make instantiating a controller with rpc channel less of a chore
### 0.0.8 -> 0.0.9
Switched from Q to when.js for better performance
